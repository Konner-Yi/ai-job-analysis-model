# Project Description

`In this project, you are to work with a dataset of your choice, and formulate a well motivated problem that can be addressed by a machine learning solution.`

**`Dataset`**

`You can collect data using any means including but not limited to the following data sources:`

1. `Standard datasets provided by PyTorch:`  
   1. `https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html`  
   2. `https://pytorch.org/text/stable/datasets.html`  
2. [`Kaggle datasets`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv) `that are publically available.`  
3. `Open data repositories available at various government agencies including Canadian Open Data portal, Statistics Canada, Ontario Open Data, or any others you find.`

**`Problem`**

`You must clearly describe your learning problem in the following contexts:`

1. `Describe the learning problem in the Jupyter Notebook.`  
2. `Describe the learning problem at the beginning of the video.`

`The types of problems that are suitable for the project include but not limited to the following:`

1. `A comparative study of different machine learning approaches`  
2. `An experimental study of a novel neural network architecture`  
3. `The training and novel application of the resulting network`

**`Neural Network Design`**

`You are at the liberty of utilizing any neural network architecture.  I recommend that you keep the architecture reasonably simple given the limited time and possible computational resources.  Be aware of the potential computational costs (time and CPU time) associated with the training.  Use the model size (number of parameters).`

`One standard technique to improve the expressive power of the network is to rely on pre-trained models as an initial network, and use limited computation to fine tune for your specific training data.`

**`Training and Deployment`**

`Going beyond the Jupyter/Colab worksheets, you are expected to investigate how the trained neural network can be integrated into applications and systems. Include in your presentation a demo of the deployment of the trained network in action.  You are expected to demonstrate a running system that uses the trained neural network.`

**`Presentation`**

`You must prepare three forms of presentation:`

1. `A public github repository containing the source code for training and deployment.  You do not need to put training data into the repository.`  
2. `A presentation (Google Slides/PowerPoints/Key Notes) on the project.`  
3. `A YouTube video (max 10 minutes) presenting and demonstrating the running of your system.`

**`Submission`**

`You are to submit your work via the following Google Form.`

`You are required to enter:`

1. `Project ID (provided to you)`  
2. `Source code (in a github repository)`  
3. `Upload presentation slides (PDF export)`  
4. `Specify the presentation YouTube video URL`
